# Interactive-Visualisations-and-Dashboards-Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## My Heroku App - https://yarovoiapp.herokuapp.com/

In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Step 1 - Plotly.js

We used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for our dashboard.

### We had to:

#### 1) Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.

#### 2) Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.

#### 3) Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`

 
## Step 2 - Heroku

Deployed our Flask app to Heroku. Link above!
